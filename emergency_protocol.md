# Emergency Contact Protocol

This document outlines the communication and action plan in case of technical issues during the submission of the XYL-PHOS-CURE proposal.

## Key Contacts

| Role | Name | Phone | Email |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CEO** | [Your Name] | [Your Phone] | [Your Email] |
| **Chemist** | Marko Marganovici | [Marko's Phone] | [Marko's Email] |
| **IT Support**| [IT Support Contact] | [IT Support Phone] | [IT Support Email] |

## Escalation Procedure

1.  **Primary Submission Failure:** If the primary submission method (e.g., office internet) fails, immediately switch to the designated backup connection (e.g., mobile hotspot).
2.  **Secondary Submission Failure:** If the backup connection also fails, the CEO will contact IT support for immediate assistance.
3.  **Portal Issues:** If the EU Funding & Tenders Portal is unresponsive or experiencing issues, the CEO will attempt to contact the portal's helpdesk. All attempts will be documented with screenshots and timestamps.
4.  **Document Corruption:** If the primary PDF is found to be corrupted, the `.docx` backup will be used to generate a new PDF.

## Communication Plan

*   The CEO is the primary point of contact for all submission-related activities.
*   The CEO will notify all key contacts of any submission issues via a group text message.
*   All team members will be on standby during the submission window.
