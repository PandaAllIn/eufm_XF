        prompt = """Create a professional mission control dashboard UI/UX for the XYL-PHOS-CURE Horizon Europe project that replaces the current minimal functional interface with a comprehensive, executive-level control center.

**Context**: You are designing for a €6M pharmaceutical R&D project coordinator who needs to monitor progress, deadlines, funding, partnerships, and regulatory milestones. The current Flask dashboard is basic - we need something that conveys the gravity and professionalism of a multi-million Euro EU research initiative.

**Project Background**:
- XYL-PHOS-CURE: First curative treatment for Xylella fastidiosa
- €6M Horizon Europe RIA (Research and Innovation Action)
- Stage 1 submitted, awaiting results (January 15, 2026)
- Stage 2 deadline: February 18, 2026
- Technology: Phosphinic acid derivatives for systemic plant therapeutics
- Impact: €5.5B economic threat, 300K jobs at risk

**Specific Requirements**:

1. **Executive Dashboard Layout**:
   - Mission-critical KPI widgets (funding burn rate, milestone progress, deadline countdown)
   - Real-time project health indicators with color-coded status (Red/Amber/Green)
   - Interactive timeline showing Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Implementation phases
   - Partner consortium map with activity indicators
   - Budget allocation pie charts and burn-rate projections

2. **Professional Visual Design**:
   - Modern, clean interface following Material Design or similar professional standards
   - Corporate blue/green color scheme reflecting pharmaceutical/research sector
   - Typography optimized for data density and readability (executive reports)
   - Responsive design supporting desktop + tablet viewing
   - Loading animations and micro-interactions for professional feel

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Progress charts for each Work Package (WP1: Chemistry, WP2: Biology, WP3: Field Trials, etc.)
   - Gantt chart view for deliverables and milestones
   - Risk assessment matrix with mitigation status
   - Financial dashboards with EU funding compliance tracking

4. **Critical Alerts System**:
   - Countdown timers for January 15, 2026 (Stage 1 results) and February 18, 2026 (Stage 2 deadline)
   - Escalation alerts for budget variances >5%
   - Partner communication status indicators
   - Regulatory approval pipeline tracking
   - Email notification integration

5. **Integration Points**:
   - Connect with existing Flask routes in app.py
   - Use current authentication system from auth.py and auth_utils.py
   - Leverage models.py data structures for project data
   - Maintain compatibility with existing notification system
   - Follow conventions defined in AGENTS.md

**Files to Modify/Create**:
- Update templates/ directory with professional dashboard layout
- Enhance static/css/ with comprehensive styling system
- Add static/js/ for interactive charts and real-time updates
- Modify dashboard routes in app.py for new data endpoints
- Create new API endpoints for dashboard data

**Technical Requirements**:
- Flask/Jinja2 template integration
- Responsive CSS Grid/Flexbox layout
- Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization
- Real-time updates via WebSocket or AJAX
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

**Success Criteria**: 
- Interface that a pharmaceutical company CEO would be comfortable presenting to EU commissioners
- Instant visual understanding of project status and critical risks
- Mobile-responsive for reviewing during travel/meetings
- Loading time <2 seconds for all dashboard components
- Professional aesthetic worthy of €6M research initiative

Please provide your detailed implementation plan before proceeding, focusing on:
1. Architecture and component structure
2. Design system and visual hierarchy
3. Data flow and API integration approach
4. Responsive breakpoints and mobile optimization
5. Performance optimization strategy

This dashboard will be the mission control center for a potentially groundbreaking agricultural innovation that could save billions in economic losses across Europe."""
