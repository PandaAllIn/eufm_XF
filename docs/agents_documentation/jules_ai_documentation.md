Jules is an AI-powered coding assistant from Google that can help you with various development tasks. It works asynchronously, meaning you can give it a task and it will work on it in the background while you focus on other things.

### 1. Getting Started

To begin using Jules, you'll need a Google account and a GitHub account with at least one repository.

*   **Go to the Jules website:** Navigate to `jules.google.com`.
*   **Sign In:** Log in with your Google account.
*   **Connect to GitHub:** Link your GitHub account to Jules. You can choose to give it access to all your repositories or only specific ones.

### 2. How to Use Jules

The workflow for using Jules involves giving it a task, reviewing its plan, and then letting it code.

*   **Select a Repository and Branch:** From the Jules dashboard, choose the repository and the specific branch you want the AI to work on.
*   **Write a Prompt:** Give Jules a clear and descriptive task. For example, instead of "fix bug," a better prompt would be, "Fix the login button on the /auth/login page that's not redirecting premium users to the dashboard after successful authentication."
*   **Review the Plan:** Jules will analyze your codebase and create a step-by-step plan of the changes it intends to make. You can review this plan and provide additional instructions if needed.
*   **Execution:** Once you approve the plan, Jules will start working on the task in a secure cloud environment. You can monitor its progress and see the code changes as it works.
*   **Review the Pull Request:** When Jules completes the task, it will create a new branch and a pull request on your GitHub repository with all the changes. You can then review the code just like you would with any other pull request before merging.

### Key Features of Jules

*   **Asynchronous Workflow:** Jules works in the background, so you can continue your work without interruption.
*   **Full Codebase Context:** It clones your entire repository to understand the context of your project, allowing it to make changes across multiple files.
*   **Variety of Tasks:** You can use Jules for tasks like fixing bugs, adding new features, writing unit tests, and improving documentation.
*   **Free Beta:** Jules is currently in a public beta and is free to use, though there are some usage limits.
