### OpenAI Codex: From Deprecated API to a New Generation of AI Coding Assistants

OpenAI has significantly evolved its approach to AI-powered coding assistance since the initial introduction of Codex. While the original Codex API was discontinued, the name and technology live on in new and more powerful forms.

#### The Original Codex API (Deprecated)

The first iteration of OpenAI Codex was launched in 2021 as a free beta. This model, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3, was trained on a massive dataset of public code repositories. It was the foundational technology behind the initial version of GitHub Copilot. However, in March 2023, OpenAI deprecated the Codex API, encouraging users to transition to the more advanced and versatile GPT-3.5 models for coding tasks.

#### the New Era of Codex

More recently, OpenAI has revived the Codex brand for a new generation of AI coding tools. These tools are designed to act as AI agents, capable of a wide range of software development tasks.

**Key features of the new Codex include:**

*   **Cloud-based and Local Operation:** Codex can operate in a sandboxed cloud environment to work on your repositories or run locally in your terminal and IDE.
*   **Broad Task Capability:** It can write new features, fix bugs, answer questions about a codebase, run tests, and propose pull requests for review.
*   **Interactive and Proactive:** Developers can delegate tasks to Codex, and it can work on them in the background, even in parallel.
*   **IDE and CLI Integration:** Codex is available as a CLI tool and has extensions for popular IDEs like VSCode.

#### How to Access the New Codex

The new Codex is available to users with ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, and Enterprise subscriptions. You can get started by visiting `chatgpt.com/codex` and connecting your GitHub account.

For developers who prefer the command line, the open-source Codex CLI can be installed via package managers like npm.

While the original Codex API is no longer available, the current OpenAI API, including models like GPT-4, provides powerful code generation and understanding capabilities. The official OpenAI API documentation and libraries provide the necessary resources to integrate these models into your applications.
