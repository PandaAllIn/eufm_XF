Here are some best practices for prompting Claude, Code Gemini, and for using the command-line interface (CLI) and VS Code effectively.

### **Claude**

To get the best results from Claude, it's helpful to be clear and structured in your prompts.

*   **Be Clear and Specific**: Provide detailed and unambiguous instructions. The more specific you are, the better Claude can understand and execute the task.
*   **Use XML Tags**: Structure your prompts with XML tags (e.g., `<document>`, `<instructions>`). This helps Claude distinguish between different parts of your prompt, such as instructions, examples, and input data.
*   **Assign a Role**: Start your prompt by assigning a role to Claude (e.g., "You are an expert Python programmer"). This sets the context and tone for the response.
*   **Provide Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)**: Include a few examples of the desired input and output. This is one of the most effective ways to improve the quality and consistency of the responses, especially for tasks that require a specific format.
*   **Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting**: For complex tasks, ask Claude to "think step-by-step" or to outline its reasoning within `<thinking>` tags. This encourages a more logical and accurate process.
*   **Place Instructions After Data**: If you are providing a large block of text or data for Claude to process, place it at the beginning of the prompt and put your instructions at the end.
*   **Iterate and Refine**: If the initial output isn't perfect, refine your prompt with more specific instructions based on the previous output. You can even ask Claude how to improve your prompt.

### **Code Gemini**

Effective prompting for Code Gemini involves providing clear context and breaking down complex problems.

*   **Be Specific and Provide Context**: Clearly define the problem and specify the programming language you're using. Provide as much relevant context as possible, such as existing code snippets or project requirements.
*   **Use Natural Language**: Write your prompts as if you were speaking to a person, rather than just using keywords.
*   **Break Down Complex Tasks**: For large or complex problems, break them down into smaller, sequential requests. This helps Gemini provide more focused and accurate answers.
*   **Provide Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)**: Give examples of the input and the desired output to guide Gemini's code generation.
*   **Specify Your Expertise Level**: Indicate your level of expertise (e.g., "explain this to me like I'm a beginner") to get a response tailored to your understanding.
*   **Use In-IDE Features**: 
    *   **Inline Prompts**: Use keyboard shortcuts like `Ctrl+I` (or `Cmd+I` on macOS) to open an inline text box for quick prompts within your code file.
    *   **Code Explanations**: Select a block of code and ask Gemini to explain it.
    *   **Generate from Comments**: Write a descriptive comment and use a shortcut like `Ctrl+Enter` to generate the corresponding code.

### **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

Efficient use of the CLI revolves around understanding its commands and using shortcuts to speed up your workflow.

*   **Learn Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
    *   **Tab Completion**: Press `Tab` to autocomplete commands, file names, and directory names. This saves time and reduces typos.
    *   **Command History**: Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through your previous commands.
*   **Know Your Commands**: 
    *   **`--help`**: Use the `--help` flag (or `-h`) with any command to see its usage, options, and examples.
    *   **`man`**: Use `man <command>` to view the manual page for a specific command.
*   **Be Cautious**: 
    *   **Dry Runs**: When available, use flags like `--dry-run` to test a command before executing it, especially for destructive operations.
    *   **Explicit Actions**: Be explicit with commands that modify or delete files. Double-check your arguments.
*   **Customize Your Environment**: 
    *   **Aliases**: Create aliases for frequently used commands to save typing.
*   **Piping and Redirection**: 
    *   Send the output of one command to another using the pipe (`|`) operator.
    *   Redirect output to files using `>` (overwrite) and `>>` (append). Send errors to `stderr` and primary output to `stdout`.

### **VS Code**

VS Code is a powerful editor with many features to boost productivity. Mastering its shortcuts and tools is key.

*   **Command Palette**: Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P`) to access the Command Palette, which allows you to execute almost any command without leaving the keyboard.
*   **Navigation**: 
    *   **Go to File**: `Ctrl+P` to quickly search for and open a file.
    *   **Go to Line**: `Ctrl+G` to jump to a specific line number.
    *   **Go to Symbol**: `Ctrl+Shift+O` to navigate to a function or variable within a file.
*   **Editing**: 
    *   **Multi-Cursor Selection**: Use `Alt+Click` (or `Option+Click`) to place cursors in multiple locations and edit them simultaneously. `Ctrl+D` selects the next occurrence of the current word.
    *   **Move Line Up/Down**: `Alt+Up/Down` to move the current line up or down.
    *   **Delete Line**: `Ctrl+Shift+K` to delete the current line.
*   **Workspace Management**: 
    *   **Integrated Terminal**: Use ``Ctrl+` `` to toggle the integrated terminal. 
    *   **Split View**: Use `Ctrl+\` to split the editor, allowing you to view multiple files side-by-side. 
    *   **Zen Mode**: Use `View > Appearance > Toggle Zen Mode` for a distraction-free editing environment.
*   **Customization**: 
    *   **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Customize keyboard shortcuts via `File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts` (`Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`). 
    *   **Settings**: Edit your user and workspace settings in JSON for fine-grained control. 
    *   **Extensions**: Use extensions to add new features, languages, and tools to your editor.
