### Gemini CLI

Gemini CLI is an open-source AI agent that brings the power of Gemini directly into your terminal. It provides a free tier allowing 60 requests per minute, access to the powerful Gemini 1.5 Pro model with a 1 million token context window, and built-in tools like Google Search and file operations. The tool is designed for developers who work primarily in the command line and is extensible through custom integrations.

Key features include code understanding and generation, automation of operational tasks, and integration with GitHub for automated pull request reviews and issue triage. You can install it via `npx`, `npm`, or `Homebrew` and authenticate using OAuth, a Gemini API Key, or Vertex AI.
