This document summarizes the key details for our project's call, sourced from the official EU Funding & Tenders Portal.

**Call Title:** Emerging and future risks to plant health

**Call Identifier:** HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-01-two-stage

**Submission Opens:** May 5, 2025

**Key Requirements & Scope:**

*   **Multi-Actor Approach:** The call explicitly requires the involvement of a diverse range of participants. This includes researchers, plant health services, farmers, foresters, advisory services, and industry representatives. This reinforces the strategy of describing the *roles* of our consortium partners in the Stage 1 proposal.
*   **Focus Area:** The call targets pests with a high probability of entering, establishing, and spreading due to factors like climate change and globalization. Our focus on *Xylella fastidiosa* is perfectly aligned with this.
*   **Collaboration:** Successful projects are expected to collaborate with other initiatives funded under the same topic. This is an important consideration for our dissemination and communication plan in Stage 2.

**Next Steps from Official Guidance:**

*   **Info Days:** Official Info Days for Horizon Cluster 6 are scheduled for May 20-21, 2025. While these dates have passed, we should search for materials or recordings from these events, as they may contain valuable insights for applicants.

This information confirms our current proposal strategy is sound and provides a solid foundation for our submission.
