# Horizon Europe Programme Guide (Summary)

This document provides a high-level summary of the Horizon Europe Programme Guide, based on information from the European Commission's website. It is intended as a quick reference and should not be considered a substitute for the official guide.

## Key Components of Horizon Europe

Horizon Europe is structured around three main pillars:

### Pillar 1: Excellent Science
This pillar supports frontier research and breakthrough scientific ideas. It includes funding for individual researchers and their teams through the European Research Council (ERC), as well as support for research infrastructures and the mobility and training of researchers.

### Pillar 2: Global Challenges and European Industrial Competitiveness
This pillar addresses major societal challenges and reinforces technological and industrial capacities. It is organized into clusters, each focusing on a different area, such as:
*   Health
*   Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society
*   Civil Security for Society
*   Digital, Industry and Space
*   Climate, Energy and Mobility
*   Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment

### Pillar 3: Innovative Europe
This pillar aims to make Europe a frontrunner in market-creating innovation. It includes the European Innovation Council (EIC) to support breakthrough and disruptive innovation, as well as initiatives to develop the overall European innovation landscape.

## Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area

In addition to the three pillars, Horizon Europe includes a component focused on "Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area." This aims to reduce disparities in research and innovation performance across Europe by supporting countries that are lagging behind.

## Open Science

A key principle of Horizon Europe is "Open Science." This approach emphasizes the open and collaborative nature of research, with a focus on the systematic sharing of knowledge and tools as early and widely as possible. The goal is to enhance the quality and efficiency of research, accelerate the advancement of knowledge, and improve the reproducibility of results.
