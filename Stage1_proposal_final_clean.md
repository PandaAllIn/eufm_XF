## Abstract

The silent spread of *Xylella fastidiosa* is a slow-motion catastrophe for European agriculture. This devastating pathogen represents an unprecedented phytosanitary crisis for the European Union, threatening multi-billion-euro agricultural sectors with annual losses estimated at €5.5 billion and risking over 300,000 jobs. Current EU strategy is a defensive stalemate, relying on containment and eradication due to the complete lack of a curative treatment.

XYL-PHOS-CURE proposes a paradigm shift to break this stalemate. We will design, synthesize, and validate a new class of systemic bactericides based on novel phosphinic acid derivatives, specifically targeting *X. fastidiosa* within the host plant. Building on the established antibiotic precedent of phosphonates (e.g., Fosfomycin) against gram-negative bacteria, our project will leverage rational drug design and world-class expertise in organophosphorus chemistry to create a focused library of compounds.

These will be rigorously screened in vitro and validated in greenhouse and controlled field trials ("Living Labs") on key host plants like olive and almond. By advancing a lead compound to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5-6, XYL-PHOS-CURE aims to deliver the first-ever effective therapeutic tool against this devastating pathogen, providing a game-changing solution to protect Europe's agricultural economy, cultural heritage, and food security, directly contributing to the European Green Deal and Farm to Fork objectives.

# Section 1: Excellence

## 1.1 Ambition and Objectives

### Overarching Ambition

The overarching ambition of XYL-PHOS-CURE is to deliver the first-ever effective, systemic, and curative treatment for plants infected with *Xylella fastidiosa*. This project moves beyond the current defensive paradigm of containment and eradication, which has proven insufficient to halt the pathogen's spread. We aim to provide European agriculture with a transformative tool that can save infected plants, protect iconic landscapes, and restore economic viability to devastated regions.

Our ambition is not incremental improvement but a fundamental breakthrough in plant health management.

### Specific Objectives

To achieve this, the project is structured around five specific, measurable, and ambitious objectives:

**Objective 1: Chemical Innovation**  
To design and synthesize a novel, focused library of at least 50 phosphinic acid derivatives with high potential for antibacterial activity against *X. fastidiosa*. By leveraging rational drug design principles based on known bacterial enzyme targets, we will create a library of novel compounds, moving beyond the state-of-the-art of existing organophosphorus chemistry in agriculture.

**Objective 2: Efficacy Screening**  
To establish the in vitro efficacy and phytotoxicity of the synthesized compounds, identifying at least three lead candidates. Through a hierarchical screening process, we will identify the most potent and safest lead candidates, determining their Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) against different subspecies of *X. fastidiosa* (*pauca, multiplex, fastidiosa*) and ensuring they exhibit minimal toxicity to host plant tissues.

**Objective 3: Systemic Validation**  
To validate the systemic uptake, translocation, and curative/preventative efficacy of lead compounds in greenhouse-grown host plants, selecting one final candidate. We will use infected olive and almond saplings in controlled biosafety environments to confirm that our lead compounds can move through the plant's xylem and effectively suppress or eliminate the pathogen, leading to a recovery of plant health.

**Objective 4: Proof-of-Concept**  
To demonstrate the proof-of-concept of the most promising candidate formulation in a relevant environment (TRL 5-6). Through small-scale, highly controlled field trials in collaboration with end-users in affected regions, we will validate the efficacy of the top candidate under real-world conditions.

**Objective 5: Exploitation Pathway**  
To develop a clear exploitation and regulatory pathway for the validated lead compound. We will create a comprehensive business plan, secure the project's intellectual property through patent applications, and map the regulatory steps required for market approval of a new plant protection product.

## 1.2 Relation to the State-of-the-Art

### Current Strategy: A Holding Action

The current European strategy against *X. fastidiosa* is a holding action born of necessity. It is defined by EU Regulation 2020/1201 and is fundamentally reactive, relying on:

- **Containment:** Establishing demarcated zones with strict movement controls
- **Eradication:** Mandatory felling of infected and surrounding host plants
- **Vector Control:** Widespread use of soil tillage and insecticides (e.g., pyrethroids) to reduce populations of the spittlebug vector, *Philaenus spumarius*

These measures are costly, environmentally impactful, socially divisive, and have failed to stop the pathogen's relentless advance. The European research landscape, supported by major projects like H2020's POnTE and XF-ACTORS, has vastly improved our understanding of the pathogen's epidemiology and detection. More recent projects, such as BIOVEXO, are exploring biopesticides. However, this entire portfolio highlights a critical innovation vacuum: there is no cure.

### Current Treatment Avenues and Their Limitations

Current research into treatments focuses on three main avenues, each with significant limitations:

1. **Biological Controls:** Antagonistic endophytes or non-virulent strains show some promise but face challenges with scalability, stability, and consistent efficacy across different environments and host species.

2. **Plant Resistance Breeding:** A vital long-term strategy, but it is a slow, generational process that cannot save the millions of currently infected, centuries-old trees that define Europe's cultural heritage.

3. **Natural Compounds:** Plant extracts and phenolic compounds often show activity in vitro but frequently lack the potency, systemic mobility, and stability required for effective field application.

### The Paradigm Shift

XYL-PHOS-CURE directly addresses this central failure point. It is not an incremental improvement on existing methods but a paradigm shift from management to therapy. By developing a targeted, systemic chemical bactericide, we offer a solution that is potentially faster to deploy than breeding, more potent and stable than biocontrols, and directly addresses the infection within the plant—a capability that is completely absent from the current state-of-the-art.

This project represents a strategic pivot from defense to offense in the fight against *Xylella fastidiosa*.

## 1.3 Novelty and Methodology

### Core Novelty

The core novelty of XYL-PHOS-CURE lies in its strategic application of advanced organophosphorus chemistry to solve a major bacteriological problem in plant health. Our approach is based on a powerful scientific rationale, moving from established principles to a novel application.

### Multi-Disciplinary Integration with Social Sciences, Humanities, and Arts (SSH)

Recognizing that successful agricultural innovation requires understanding of socio-economic factors, the project integrates agricultural economics analysis to assess adoption barriers, farmer willingness-to-pay, and the broader economic implications of our therapeutic approach. This SSH dimension will inform both our technology development (ensuring practical applicability) and our dissemination strategy (understanding market dynamics and social acceptance factors).

### Scientific Rationale: The Conceptual Leap

Our hypothesis is built on a logical extension of established science:

1. **Known:** Phosphonates (a class of organophosphorus compounds) are widely used as systemic fungicides (e.g., against *Phytophthora*), known for their excellent mobility in the plant xylem and phloem.

2. **Precedent:** A specific phosphonate, Fosfomycin, is a clinically successful broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against gram-negative bacteria, the same class as *X. fastidiosa*. Fosfomycin works by irreversibly inhibiting MurA, a key enzyme in bacterial cell wall synthesis.

3. **The Leap:** If a phosphonate can be a potent antibiotic, then it is highly plausible that novel phosphinic acid derivatives—a related but distinct and underexplored chemical family—can be designed as potent and selective bactericides against *X. fastidiosa*. Phosphinic acids offer a different structural and electronic profile, providing a vast chemical space for discovering molecules that can act as stable mimics (isosteres) of natural enzyme substrates, thereby blocking essential metabolic pathways in the bacterium.

This project is not a random screening of existing chemicals; it is a rational design effort. The consortium brings together deep, doctoral-level expertise in phosphinic acid synthesis from a specialist academic chemistry group, computational modeling capabilities from a dedicated research institute, and decades of practical experience in plant bacteriology from a leading agricultural university.

### Methodological Approach

Our methodology follows a rigorous, stage-gated progression from concept to proof-of-concept. The project is built on a foundation of interdisciplinary expertise, with a specialist SME coordinating activities between partners renowned for their work in synthetic chemistry, microbiology, plant pathology, and agronomy. The project is structured into logical work packages (WPs) that de-risk the innovation sequentially.

This interdisciplinary approach ensures that our chemical innovations are always guided by biological relevance and practical applicability.

**Phase 1: Design & Synthesis (WP2)**
- **Rational Design:** We will use computational modelling to identify and analyse potential enzyme targets within *X. fastidiosa* that are essential for its survival and distinct from host plant metabolism.
- **Library Synthesis:** A core team with specialised expertise in phosphinic acid chemistry will synthesize a focused library of novel derivatives designed to inhibit these targets. This moves beyond simply testing off-the-shelf compounds and represents true chemical innovation.

**Phase 2: Hierarchical Screening & Selection (WP3)**
- **Primary Screening (in vitro):** All synthesized compounds will be tested against pure cultures of multiple *X. fastidiosa* subspecies to determine their direct bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity (MIC values).
- **Secondary Screening (Phytotoxicity):** Promising candidates will be tested on plant cell cultures (e.g., olive, almond) to eliminate those with unacceptable toxicity to the host plant. This "fail-fast" approach ensures resources are focused only on the most viable candidates.

**Phase 3: Controlled Environment Validation (WP4)**
- **Systemic Activity:** Lead compounds will be applied to infected potted saplings in high-level biosafety greenhouses. We will use qPCR and other molecular techniques to quantify the reduction in bacterial titre in different parts of the plant, confirming systemic uptake and efficacy.
- **Curative & Preventative Trials:** We will test the compounds' ability to both cure existing infections (curative) and protect healthy plants from subsequent infection (preventative).

**Phase 4: Real-World Proof-of-Concept (WP5)**
- **"Living Lab" Trials:** In close collaboration with end-user partners (e.g., agricultural cooperatives), the top candidate formulation will be tested in small-scale, highly controlled field settings in demarcated zones. These trials will be co-designed with farmers to ensure practical relevance and will provide the crucial data to validate the technology in a relevant environment (TRL 5-6).
- **JRC Knowledge Centre Collaboration:** Building on the project's scientific foundation, we will establish collaborative links with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) Knowledge Centre for plant health, particularly leveraging their expertise in phytosanitary risk assessment and their comprehensive databases on *X. fastidiosa* distribution and impact. This collaboration will enhance the project's policy relevance and ensure our findings contribute to evidence-based EU policy development.

This robust, multi-stage methodology ensures that the project's ambitious goals are pursued through a logical, scientifically sound, and de-risked pathway, maximising the probability of success. The integration of end-users from the design of field trials onwards embodies the Multi-Actor Approach required by the call, ensuring our solution is not only effective but also practical and adoptable.

## 1.4 Risk Management

A proactive approach to risk management is integrated into the project structure. We have identified potential risks and developed mitigation strategies to ensure the project remains on track to achieve its objectives.

**R1 - Scientific/Technical Risk:** The designed phosphinic acid derivatives show low efficacy against *X. fastidiosa*  
*Likelihood: Medium | Impact: High*  
*Mitigation:* The project employs a hierarchical screening process, allowing for the early identification of non-viable compound families. The diverse library of 50+ compounds increases the probability of identifying multiple lead candidates.

**R2 - Operational Risk:** Delays in the synthesis of the chemical library impact the project timeline  
*Likelihood: Medium | Impact: Medium*  
*Mitigation:* The consortium includes a specialist academic chemistry group with a proven track record in complex synthesis. A buffer period is built into the project plan for WP2.

**R3 - Regulatory Risk:** The lead candidate faces unforeseen regulatory hurdles for use as a plant protection product  
*Likelihood: Low | Impact: High*  
*Mitigation:* The project includes early-stage consultation with regulatory experts (WP5) to ensure the data generated meets the requirements for future registration.

**R4 - Field Trial Risk:** The "Living Lab" trials (WP5) are impacted by external factors (e.g., weather, disease pressure)  
*Likelihood: Medium | Impact: Medium*  
*Mitigation:* The project will establish multiple trial sites with diverse conditions. Close collaboration with local agricultural cooperatives will ensure rapid response to any issues.

**R5 - Exploitation Risk:** The developed technology is not adopted by end-users, limiting the project's impact  
*Likelihood: Low | Impact: High*  
*Mitigation:* The project's Multi-Actor Approach, including the early involvement of farmers and agricultural cooperatives in "Living Lab" trials, is designed to ensure the solution is practical and meets user needs. A strong business plan and dissemination strategy (WP6) will further drive adoption.

This risk management framework will be actively monitored and updated throughout the project lifecycle by the project management team (WP1).

## 2.2 Scale and Significance of Project Outcomes

The success of XYL-PHOS-CURE will generate profound and lasting impacts across Europe.

### Economic Impact

The threat is staggering: a full spread of *X. fastidiosa* could cause €5.5 billion in annual production losses and jeopardise 300,000 jobs. The olive oil sector, worth billions annually, is particularly vulnerable, with some Italian regions seeing production collapse by up to 80%.

- **Protection of Assets:** Our solution will protect high-value agricultural assets, including 70% of the EU's older olive trees and significant portions of the almond (€1.1bn/year) and citrus sectors.
- **Market Creation:** The project will create a new, high-value market for a European-developed plant protection product. The coordinating SME will own the core IP, fostering innovation and competitiveness within the EU bio-economy.
- **Restoration of Confidence:** A cure will restore farmer and investor confidence, unlocking investment in affected regions and revitalising rural economies.

### Societal Impact

The impact of *X. fastidiosa* extends beyond balance sheets into the heart of European culture.

- **Preservation of Cultural Heritage:** The project will provide a tool to save ancient, centuries-old olive groves in Italy, Spain, and Greece, which are irreplaceable components of the Mediterranean landscape and cultural identity.
- **Strengthening Rural Communities:** By protecting the livelihoods of farmers and associated workers, our solution will combat rural depopulation and preserve the social fabric of communities dependent on agriculture.
- **Reducing Social Conflict:** An effective treatment will reduce the need for controversial mandatory felling orders, mitigating the significant social and political friction that currently hampers control efforts.
- **Gender Dimension:** While *X. fastidiosa* management does not present explicit gender-specific biological or technological challenges, the broader agricultural context demonstrates significant gender disparities in farm ownership, decision-making authority, and access to extension services. The project's dissemination and training activities will specifically address these disparities by ensuring equal participation of male and female farmers in our "Living Lab" demonstrations and by developing communication materials that are accessible and relevant to all farm decision-makers regardless of gender.

### Environmental Impact

XYL-PHOS-CURE is fully aligned with the European Green Deal and Farm to Fork Strategy.

- **Reduced Pesticide Use:** Current vector control strategies rely on broad-spectrum insecticides. By providing a direct treatment for the bacterium, our solution will reduce the pressure for intensive insecticide spraying, leading to positive outcomes for biodiversity, pollinators, and soil health.
- **Sustainable Intensification:** By saving productive trees from disease, the project supports the goal of producing more with less environmental impact, preventing the need to clear new land for agriculture.
- **FAIR Data Management:** The project is committed to implementing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data management principles throughout all research activities. All experimental data, chemical synthesis protocols, biological assay results, and field trial outcomes will be systematically documented, curated, and made available through appropriate open data repositories, ensuring maximum transparency and enabling future research building on our findings. This approach supports the European Open Science agenda and maximizes the long-term impact of EU investment in research.

### Policy Impact

The availability of a cure would be a game-changer for EU plant health policy. It would provide policymakers at the EU (DG SANTE) and national levels with a powerful new tool, enabling a shift from a rigid, defensive strategy to a more flexible and effective Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach that includes therapeutic intervention. This could lead to a fundamental revision of EU Regulation 2020/1201, allowing for the management and recovery of infected orchards where eradication is no longer feasible or desirable.

## 2.3 Dissemination, Exploitation, and Communication (DEC) Plan

A robust DEC plan is central to maximising the project's impact. A dedicated work package will ensure our results reach the right audiences through targeted channels. A specialist SME with a focus on innovation management and agricultural technology will lead the exploitation activities, ensuring a clear path to market. This SME will be supported by a partner with a proven track record in technology transfer and a pan-European agricultural advisory network to ensure maximum outreach and impact.

### Exploitation

Our exploitation strategy is commercially focused and designed for rapid market entry post-project.

- **Intellectual Property (IP) Management:** The core novelty—the chemical structures of the new phosphinic acid derivatives and their use against *X. fastidiosa*—will be protected via patent applications filed early in the project. The project consortium will operate under a robust Consortium Agreement that clearly defines ownership (with the coordinating SME owning the core compound IP) and access rights.
- **Commercialisation Pathway:** The primary route to market will be through the coordinating SME, which will seek to license the patented technology to a major agrochemical company. This model leverages the partner's global manufacturing capacity, distribution network, and expertise in navigating the complex regulatory approval process for plant protection products, while generating revenue for the SME through licensing fees and royalties.
- **Business Planning:** A comprehensive business and investment plan will be developed to attract follow-on funding (e.g., from the EIC Accelerator, venture capital) to take the TRL 5-6 product through the final stages of development and regulatory approval.
