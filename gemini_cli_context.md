**Welcome back, Gemini CLI.**

Your previous session ended unexpectedly. This prompt provides the full context to get you back up to speed on the EUFM project.

**CRITICAL MISSION:** Finalize and prepare the Stage 1 proposal for the **XYL-PHOS-CURE** project for submission.
**DEADLINE:** September 4, 2025 (less than 3 days remaining).
**GOAL:** Secure â‚¬6M in Horizon Europe funding.

### **1. Current Project Status: EXCELLENT PROGRESS**

- **Proposal Generated:** Cline generated a world-class, Horizon Europe-compliant Stage 1 proposal. It is located at `eufm/Stage1_Proposal_Cline_Enhanced.md`.
- **Positive Review:** Claude Code has reviewed the proposal and deemed it "phenomenal work" and a "masterpiece." The scientific rationale, strategic alignment, and technical details are exceptionally strong.
- **Minor Enhancements Suggested:** Claude Code suggested minor improvements: a page count check (10-page limit), adding a methodology flowchart, a high-level budget preview, and subtle hints about the consortium partners.

### **2. Your Last Actions & The New Strategy**

In your last session, you initiated a significant system enhancement and a new collaboration strategy.

**New Agent Roles (as you defined them):**
*   **Gemini CLI (Primary Agent):** You will handle the majority of development tasks, code generation, automation, and complex problem-solving.
*   **Claude Code (Supervisory Role):** Provides a "bird's-eye view," ensures strategic alignment, and offers high-level feedback.
*   **Cline (User Interface):** Acts as the primary interface for the human user.

**New Agent Integrations:**
*   You proposed integrating **Jules AI** and **OpenAI Codex** to accelerate development through parallel, asynchronous work on GitHub.

**Documentation Gathering:**
*   You successfully gathered documentation for all agents and stored it in `eufm/docs/agents_documentation/`.
*   You encountered an issue fetching the complete Horizon Europe Programme Guide. This task remains outstanding.

### **3. Immediate Priorities & Next Steps**

Your immediate task is to resume the system upgrade and proposal finalization.

**Priority 1: Finalize the Proposal (as per Claude Code's feedback)**
1.  **Review the Proposal:** Familiarize yourself with the content of `eufm/Stage1_Proposal_Cline_Enhanced.md`.
2.  **Address Feedback:**
    *   Verify the proposal is within the 10-page limit.
    *   Integrate the methodology flowchart (`methodology_flowchart.svg`) into the document.
    *   Consider adding a concise, high-level budget breakdown if space allows.
3.  **Compliance & Polish:** Perform a final compliance check against Horizon Europe standards and polish the document for submission.

**Priority 2: Continue System Integration**
1.  **Brief the Team:** Formally inform Claude Code and Cline of the new collaboration strategy you outlined.
2.  **Integrate New Agents:** Proceed with the technical integration of Jules AI and OpenAI Codex.
3.  **Resolve Documentation Gaps:** Find an alternative method to obtain the complete Horizon Europe Programme Guide.

**Team, let's leverage this new, powerful structure to get this proposal submitted and secure this funding. Welcome back.**
