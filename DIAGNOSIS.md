# Prompt #9 Failure Diagnosis

## 1) What I can observe
- .git directory exists: **Yes**.
- Current branch name: `work` (from `.git/HEAD`).
- Remote configured: **No** (`.git/config` lacks any `[remote]` sections).
- Uncommitted files: none apparent; working tree appears clean.
- Detached HEAD/branch mismatch: HEAD points to `work` instead of expected `main`.

## 2) Most likely causes of Prompt #9 failure (ranked)
1. No remote configured, so `git push` had no destination.
2. Branch rename to `main` failed or was skipped, leaving branch `work` checked out.
3. `.git` directory already present, causing `git init`/`branch -M` commands to misbehave.
4. Authentication (token/2FA) missing or insufficient for push.
5. Default branch mismatch (`work` vs `main`) on remote.
6. Pre-existing history elsewhere causing push rejection.

## 3) Evidence
- `.git/HEAD`
  ```
  ref: refs/heads/work
  ```
- `.git/config`
  ```
  [core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
  ```
- Top-level file list
  ```

  requirements.txt

  ```
- `git status --short` produced no output (clean work tree).

## 4) Remediation options
### Fix A – No-terminal path
Follow `PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to create the repo and open a PR via the GitHub web interface.

### Fix B – Branch/remote cleanup (terminal)
1. `git rev-parse --git-dir`
2. `git branch -M main`
3. `git remote add origin <repo-url>`
4. `git push -u origin main`

### Fix C – CI-first bootstrap
Create a GitHub Actions workflow that commits and opens a PR using `GITHUB_TOKEN` once the repository exists. Requires initial push to enable Actions.
