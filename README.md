## ðŸš€ Project Status: Stage 1 Submitted Successfully!

**Proposal ID**: 101271185-1  
**Call**: HORIZON-CL6-2025-02-FARM2FORK-01-two-stage  
**Submitted**: September 4, 2025  
**Status**: Awaiting Stage 1 evaluation results (Expected: January 2026)

## Project Overview

XYL-PHOS-CURE aims to develop the first systemic curative treatment for Xylella fastidiosa, the plant pathogen threatening â‚¬5.5 billion in EU agricultural production. Our novel approach uses phosphinic acid derivatives to create systemic bactericides that can cure infected olive, citrus, and almond trees.

## The Problem

- **Xylella fastidiosa** is Europe's most dangerous plant pathogen
- **â‚¬5.5 billion** annual economic threat to EU agriculture  
- **No cure exists** - only containment and vector control
- Affects olive groves, citrus orchards, and almond trees across Mediterranean regions
- Threatens 300,000 agricultural jobs in the EU

## Our Innovation

### Novel Chemistry Approach
- **Phosphinic acid derivatives** designed for systemic plant uptake
- Based on proven antibacterial activity (Fosfomycin precedent)
- Targets gram-negative bacterial metabolism
- Systemic delivery via xylem transport

### Chemistry-to-Field Pathway
1. **In-silico design** â†’ Rational compound selection
2. **Synthesis** â†’ 25-40 novel phosphinic acid derivatives  
3. **In-vitro validation** â†’ Anti-Xylella activity screening
4. **Greenhouse trials** â†’ Systemic uptake and efficacy
5. **Living lab pilots** â†’ Field validation with farmers

## Project Timeline

- **Duration**: 42 months
- **Budget**: â‚¬6M (Horizon Europe RIA)
- **Target TRL**: 2-3 â†’ 5-6
- **Stage 1 Results**: January 2026
- **Stage 2 Deadline**: February 18, 2026 (if selected)

**Target Partners**: Plant pathology labs, agricultural cooperatives, formulation companies

## Impact Vision

A successful XYL-PHOS-CURE project will deliver:
- First curative treatment for Xylella fastidiosa
- Systemic solution complementing containment strategies  
- Protection of European agricultural heritage
- New chemical class for plant health therapeutics
- Economic benefit of billions in prevented losses
