# European Union Funds Manager (EU FM)

## Overview

The European Union Funds Manager (EU FM) is a software project aimed at using AI to help people implement projects using non-refundable funds from the European Union. Our initial focus is on funds available in Romania.

## Project Status

As of [date], we are in the early stages of the project. Our current goals are to:

1. Identify a database or list of all EU funds available in Romania.
2. Understand the structure of these funds and their application processes.

## Current Progress

So far, we have identified an overview of EU funding programmes implemented through the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework. This includes a range of programmes and funds under various headings. For more details, see the 'EU Funding Programmes' section below.

## Next Steps

Our next steps are to:

1. Continue searching for a database or list of EU funds specifically available in Romania.
2. Begin designing the structure of our AI tool, which will guide users through the process of applying for and managing these funds.

## EU Funding Programmes

Details about the funding programmes identified so far can be found in the 'EU Funding Programmes' directory of this repository.
