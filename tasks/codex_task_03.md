**Objective:**
As a technical writer, your task is to create a comprehensive, professional `README.md` file that properly documents our newly refactored system.

Create a new `eufm/README.md` file that includes the following sections:

*   **Features:** A list of the key features of the system (e.g., proposal generation, multi-agent collaboration).
*   **Architecture Diagram:** A simple ASCII diagram showing the new project structure.
*   **Getting Started:** Instructions on how to set up the project, including how to use `poetry` to install dependencies.
*   **Usage Examples:** A few examples of how to run the key scripts or interact with the system.

**Context:**
The `README.md` should be clear, concise, and easy for a new developer to understand.

**Deliverable:**
Submit your work as a single Pull Request against the `main` branch with the new `README.md` file.
