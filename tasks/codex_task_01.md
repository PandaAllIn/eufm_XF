**Assigned To:** OpenAI Codex
**Task ID:** CODEX-20250831-001
**Title:** Research Multi-Agent Collaboration Patterns

**Objective:**
As an AI Workflow Specialist, your task is to research how different AI models and agents can work together more effectively.

**Task:**
1.  **Sources:** Conduct a thorough search on developer forums and communities, with a focus on:
    *   Reddit (specifically r/LocalLLaMA, r/LangChain, r/GPT3)
    *   Hacker News
    *   Other relevant software engineering blogs or communities.
2.  **Topics:** Your research should focus on patterns and techniques for:
    *   Multi-agent collaboration between different LLMs (e.g., workflows combining Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI models).
    *   AI agent orchestration frameworks (e.g., AutoGen, CrewAI).
    *   "Agent Router" or "Task Dispatcher" patterns, where a primary agent decides which specialized agent is best suited for a given task.
3.  **Deliverable:** Create a new Markdown file at `eufm/docs/multi_agent_research.md` summarizing your findings. The summary should include links to the most insightful discussions and an analysis of the most promising techniques for our project.

**Context:**
The goal is to find practical, implementable strategies that can improve the synergy between the AI agents in our project.

**Deliverable:**
Submit your work as a single Pull Request against the `main` branch with the new `multi_agent_research.md` file.
