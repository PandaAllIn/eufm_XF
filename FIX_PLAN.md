# Remediation Plan

Based on the findings in [DIAGNOSIS.md](DIAGNOSIS.md), the repository lacks a configured remote and the working branch is `work` instead of `main`.

1. Confirm the repository state:
   - `git status`
2. Rename the current branch to `main` if needed:
   - `git branch -M main`
3. Add the GitHub remote (only if `git remote` shows none):
   - `git remote add origin <ssh-or-https-url>`
4. Push the branch and set the upstream:
   - `git push -u origin main`

These steps safely connect the local repository to GitHub and establish `main` as the primary branch.
