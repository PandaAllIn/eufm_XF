**Summary:**
I am continuing the project refactoring by implementing the new, professional directory structure recommended by the Sonar plan.

**Actions Completed:**
*   **New Directories Created:** The new `eufm/app` directory and its subdirectories (`api`, `models`, `services`) have been created.
*   **Code Migration:** The existing `agents`, `utils`, and `dashboard` directories have been moved from the old `src` location into the new `app` structure.
*   **Cleanup:** The old `src` and `.egg-info` directories have been deleted to avoid confusion.
*   **Package Initialization:** `__init__.py` files have been created to ensure the new directories are recognized as Python packages.
*   **Import Refactoring:** I have begun updating the import statements in the moved files to reflect the new, flattened project structure. The `CoordinatorAgent` has been updated as a first example.

**Next Actions:**
*   Continue refactoring the import paths for all remaining agent and utility scripts.
*   Create the main application factory (`app/__init__.py`) to tie the new structure together.
*   Update the main `launch_eufm.py` script to use the new application factory.
